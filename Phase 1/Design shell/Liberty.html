    <div><b>Fact about Statue of Liberty</b> </div>

        <p>
            <li>A REAL PERSON WAS USED TO CREATE THE STATUE.
                <li>Frederic Bartholdi has surpassed any Mother's Day present you could think of: he modeled the world's most famous statue after his mother, Charlotte.</li> <br>
            <br>
            <li>NWHEN THE STATUE FIRST ARRIVED FROM FRANCE, SHE WAS THE COLOR OF A SHINY NEW PENNY.
                It took roughly 20 years for Liberty to patina to the greenish-blue hue she is today.
