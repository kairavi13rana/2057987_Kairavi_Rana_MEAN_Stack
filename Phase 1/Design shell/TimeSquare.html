    <div><b>Fact about Time TimeSquare</b> </div>

        <p>
            <li>In 1907, the first New Year's Eve ball drop took place in Times Square. The tradition is still continuing strong, with over a million people attending each year.</li> <br>
            <li>Every year, it attracts 50 million tourists.
                That is the most of any tourist destination in the United States. Even then, we must point out that if 60 million people visit New York City each year, that implies 10 million of them travel but do not visit Times Square.</li><br>
